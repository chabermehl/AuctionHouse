# Project: Auction House
## Student(s):  Alexander Booher, Charles Habermehl, Farhang Rouhi

## Introduction
The goal of this project was to create an agent-controlled auction house system that utilizes network sockets for communication between each of the functioning components. 
The agent can create a bank account, get a list of auctions from their bank, and connect to a chosen auction house to bid on items.

## Contributions
Alex Booher worked on the Auction House component.
Charles Habermehl worked on the Bank component.
Farhang Rouhi worked on the Agent component.

## Usage
Give details about how to use the program. (Imagine making it easy for someone that you don't know to run and use your project.)
Our program was made with the console being the primary way to interact with the system. 
It outputs important information and each compnent takes in string commands.
